# üîç FeedbackSentinel Project.

FeedbackSentinel is an AI-powered sentiment analysis tool that classifies customer feedback into "Like" or "Dislike" categories. It uses a fine-tuned language model (like DistilBERT or RoBERTa) for fast, accurate classification and handles sarcasm or ambiguous comments using GPT-4.

The tool offers a FastAPI backend for processing text and a React dashboard to visualize results in real time. It can also analyze comments from 
website links and integrate with tools like Slack or a Chrome extension.

Use cases: Improve customer support, track product sentiment, and enhance marketing insights.
